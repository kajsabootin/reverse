# reverse

Please write a javascript function that takes a JSON object as input and returns it with all keys/values switched and the (new) value reversed.
{'person': 'beans'}
should output
{'beans':'nosrep'}

Be mindful of the nested nature and the different data types that JSON offers.
How input/output works is left up to you.
